# Project - Train Together 

## Introduction
Planning to run a marathon is not an easy task. It involves meticulous planning, keeping track of performance over time and also being motivated. While training individually is initially fun, the motivation usually tapers off while training alone and it isn't something you are enthusiastic about it anymore. But suppose, you were to have like-minded individuals with whom you could team up or group with the intention of running together, training and working hard to achieve your goal, then it would help keep up the motivation level high and also provide inspiration and enthusiasm to honor the commitment. The idea is to essentially build an app which would help individuals find running partners around nearby locations, thereby enabling people to **train together** for a particular marathon. The app will help pair people to create groups and choose partners who have the same marathon event interest. It will allow users to run and train together, compare statistics, inspire each other and finally compete at the marathon successfully.
